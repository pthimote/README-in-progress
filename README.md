## subtitle 
I've been learning how to become a software engineer for a couple of months. In my studies ive learned how to do the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Javascript. Taking classes as a flex student at FlatIron school. 

Before wanting to pursue this career, i was an mma coach and amateur mma fighter in NY. For over a decade ive been learing martial arts and dedcated 5 years in to fighting. Before wanting to change careers i had to make my peace with not fighting again. I am happy to say i accomplished getting 2 titles on my waist under the lightweight division.
