## Bio
I've been learning how to become a software engineer for a couple of months. In my studies ive learned how to do the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Javascript. Taking classes as a flex student at FlatIron school. My goal is to finish and work be able to work remote because ive spent more time away from home in prior jobs, and less time in family functions.

Before wanting to pursue this career, I was an mma coach and amateur mma fighter in NY. For over a decade ive been learing martial arts and dedcated 5 years in to fighting. Before wanting to change careers i had to make my peace with not fighting again. I am happy to say i accomplished getting 2 titles on my waist under the lightweight division.

The time i spend teaching I enjoyed helping others become better versions of themselves. Many people would come for different reasons on why to join a martial arts gym. To get in better shape, be competitive, and or because they were bullyed and wanted to protect themselves. Teaching those under me, how to be a better version of themselves was diffcult when there surrounds was in choas. some maneged to stay and see the difference for the good in their lives and others no so well. Training students to become fighters is a proud achivement and also a huge change in a persons mindset. Few times ive had to no to people becuase theyve thought it easy and because of ehat they saw on tv. I can say the worst response to someone wanting me to coach them is that person saying they dont care if they loose, cause i told them if thats the case go fight a bum on the streets. For anyone that fights your not just representing yourself, your representing your your coachs and the gym you came from. The people who are serious about competeting want to win, and ask questions more so on how can they improve on strength's and weakness.
